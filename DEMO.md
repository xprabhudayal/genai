## üîç Expected AI Output

### Simplified Text Example:
```
- Simplified Text: 
  Party A (called "the Company") and Party B (called "the Contractor") want to make a binding agreement for professional services. The parties have agreed on the terms and conditions listed here. In exchange for the promises made by both sides, the parties agree to the following:

- Key Terms Explained:
  ‚Ä¢ "WHEREAS" - This introduces the background reasons for the agreement
  ‚Ä¢ "hereinafter" - Means "from this point forward in this document"
  ‚Ä¢ "consideration" - Something of value exchanged between parties to make a contract binding
  ‚Ä¢ "covenants" - Promises or agreements made in the contract

- Summary: 
  This is a service agreement between a company and a contractor for professional consulting services. The contract lasts 12 months, pays $5,000 monthly, and can be terminated with 30 days notice. It includes confidentiality requirements and is governed by California law.
```

### Term Explanation Example:
```
**Force Majeure**

A simple definition: Force majeure means "superior force" and refers to events that are beyond anyone's control, like natural disasters, wars, or government actions.

A practical example: If a hurricane destroys your office building and you can't fulfill a contract, that's force majeure.

Why it's important: This clause protects you from being held responsible for things you can't control, like natural disasters or government shutdowns.
```
